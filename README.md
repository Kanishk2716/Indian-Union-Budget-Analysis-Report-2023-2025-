# Indian-Union-Budget-Analysis-Report (2023-2025)

The Union Budget of India is a vital policy instrument reflecting the governmentâ€™s priorities, allocation strategies, and financial planning. It determines how funds are distributed across various ministries to achieve socio-economic development and national security, among other goals. This project aims to analyze budgetary trends across different Indian ministries over the financial years 2023 (Actuals), 2024 (Revised Estimates), and 2025 (Budget Estimates).

This analysis allows us to assess how budget priorities have evolved year-over-year, highlight growth or reductions in allocations, and identify which ministries see the most significant focus or cutbacks.

## Objective of the Project
- The primary objectives of this budget analysis are:

- To examine allocation patterns across ministries from 2023 to 2025.

- To identify the top and bottom budgeted ministries.

- To analyze year-over-year growth or decline in allocations.

- To visualize budget shifts using interactive dashboards for better decision-making and public understanding.
